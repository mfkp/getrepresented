About Get Represented
---------------------

We need to use the Internet to make it so that communicating to congress, 
whether you're an activist, lobbyist, advocacy group, or just John Q. Public, 
is easy and effective. It should aggregate ideas and allow people to publicly 
send messages to congress and allow for the public to read those messages and 
see what their neighbors are telling their representatives. Get Represented 
takes a look at the GetSatisfaction.com model and tries to apply it to Congress.

How it works
------------------
* User registers with username, email, password, and address (optional openid)
* Congress members are assigned to user based on address/ congressional district
* User can post questions, ideas, problems, and praise for any one of their assigned members
* User can petition congress member to join site if they are not already registered
* Users can vote on any posted items by other users, and sort by popularity and activity
* Users can comment on any posted items
* Congress members can respond directly to user feedback
* ????
* Profit
